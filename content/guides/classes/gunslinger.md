identity:
  name: Weapon Wheel
  description: The Weapon Wheel allows you to switch between the three stances, each stance having its own defining trait that changes your playstyle. Handgun skills are mostly utility and mobility, while Shotgun and Rifle skills are mostly damage skills for mid and long range. On the wheel, the tiny grayed-out squares represent abilities that are not available, while the colored ones indicate an ability that is ready to cast.

  name: Crit Rate Increase
  description: Increases crit rate by 10%. Applied through first-row tripods on Spiral Tracker, Dexterous Shot, and AT02 Grenade — run at least two of the three as synergy skills, or AT02 Grenade at level 10 as a solo synergy.
  skills:
    - Spiral Tracker
    - Dexterous Shot
    - AT02 Grenade
builds:
  - name: Peacemaker
    engraving: Peacemaker
    description: Focuses on stance swapping to utilize both Shotgun and Rifle skills. High skill expression with mobile, consistent, ranged DPS — but extremely squishy, expensive due to gems, and prone to very long animation locks.
    playstyle: Swap between Handgun, Shotgun, and Rifle stances — weave Handgun utility skills between your Shotgun and Rifle damage skills to keep synergy and bleed uptime while landing your primary damage skills.

        description: Standard Peacemaker but better — the Eye of the Tigress core is a general damage increase across all skills and plays the same as base Peacemaker.
        stats: Critical 20/30, Specialization 20/30
        arkgrid_cores: Eye of the Tigress + Jack-of-All-Trades + All-Rounder
        arkgrid_prose: |-
          Cores are Eye of the Tigress (Sun), Jack-of-All-Trades (Moon), and All-Rounder (Star).
          Standard Peacemaker but better! General damage increase across all skills, plays the same.
          Chaos cores: Flashy Attack (Sun), Smoldering Strike (Moon), Attack (Star).
        priorities:
          - This is NOT a strict rotation — Gunslinger works on a skill priority system, weaving Synergy -> Damage -> Synergy.
          - Prioritize your T skill, Focused Shot, Sharpshooter, Dual Buckshot, and Target Down as the situation allows.
          - Weave pistol skills in between DPS skills to maintain synergy, bleed, and Life Absorption uptime.
          - Run at least two of Spiral Tracker, Dexterous Shot, and AT02 Grenade as synergy skills, or AT02 Grenade at level 10 as a solo synergy.
          - Pre-stack Adrenaline before entering the raid with filler pistol skills.
          - Always enter the raid having cast 2 pistol skills to activate Destiny.
          - Make sure to swap weapons and back to maintain the Peacemaker buff if dodging — all damage should be done under the Peacemaker buff.

        arkPassiveTips:
          - Your crit and spec stats are subject to change depending on gearing — aim to have 95%+ crit after synergy (10), Pacifist (15), and Adrenaline (14-20). Adjust crit stat as necessary, then put the remainder into spec.
          - If you find yourself having lower uptime on DPS, go Unlimited Magick 1 and Zealous Smite 1.

        difficulty: 3
        description: Shotgun-focused Ark Grid setup revolving around Last Request buffing other shotgun skills, and shotgun skills resetting Last Request. Drops Hour of Judgment for Shotgun Rapid Fire. Incredibly high stagger and weak point with competitive performance to Eye of the Tigress.
        stats: Critical 20/30, Specialization 20/30
        arkgrid_cores: Echoes of the Banquet + Weapon Switch + Blowback
        arkgrid_prose: |-
          Cores are Echoes of the Banquet (Sun), Weapon Switch (Moon), and Blowback (Star).
          Shotgun focused core revolving around Last Request buffing other shotgun skills, and other shotgun skills resetting Last Request. Gameplay revolves around Last Request -> Shotgun Skill -> Last Request -> Shotgun Skill, followed by your other damage skills once you run out of shotgun skills.
          This playstyle has incredibly high stagger and weakpoint and has competitive performance to Eye of the Tigress.
          Chaos cores: Flashy Attack (Sun), Smoldering Strike (Moon), Attack (Star).
        priorities:
          - Gameplay revolves around Last Request into a shotgun skill, then Last Request again — shotgun skills reset Last Request, and Last Request buffs the following shotgun skill.
          - Once you run out of shotgun skills, use your other damage skills.
          - Weave pistol skills in between DPS skills to maintain synergy, bleed, and Life Absorption uptime.
          - Run at least two of Spiral Tracker, Dexterous Shot, and AT02 Grenade as synergy skills, or AT02 Grenade at level 10 as a solo synergy.
          - Always enter the raid having cast 2 pistol skills to activate Destiny.
          - Make sure to swap weapons and back to maintain the Peacemaker buff if dodging — all damage should be done under the Peacemaker buff.

        arkPassiveTips:
          - Your crit and spec stats are subject to change depending on gearing — aim to have 95%+ crit after synergy (10), Pacifist (15), and Adrenaline (14-20). Adjust crit stat as necessary, then put the remainder into spec.
          - If you find yourself having lower uptime on DPS, go Unlimited Magick 1 and Zealous Smite 1.
