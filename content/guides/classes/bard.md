        description: Standard support Bard build. Plays nearly identically to pre-ark grid build, but with an extra stack of Rhythm Buckshot that resets on counters. This build will scale the best when opting to increase spec levels.
        stats: Specialization 16/30, Swiftness 24/30
        arkgrid_cores: Seraphic Accent + Seraphic Pulse + Buckshot Acceleration
        arkgrid_prose: |-
          Prioritize Seraphic Pulse > Seraphic Accent > Buckshot Acceleration
          Minimum Sun 14 Moon 14 Star 10, but you really want Sun/Moon at 17 and Star at 14.
          Every combination of Sun/More core is viable, however Seraphic Pulse/Seraphic Accent (AP core) will have the most consistent performance. Brave Pulse/Brave Accent (identity core) is comparable, but it depends on your Serenade of Courage uptime. Any mix of Seraphic + Brave will suffice. Aria Accent/Aria Pulse (T core) is the weakest and will scale poorly with increased specialization, as you decrease your cooldown reduction, directly decreasing your Aria uptime.
          Seraphic and Brave ancients will always outperform the relic variants. Aria ancient will only outperform based on uptime.
        priorities:
          - Upkeep main damage buffs and debuffs, including Attack Power Buff (Heavenly Tune, Sonic Vibration), Brand (Sonatina/Sound Shock), Identity Buff (Serenade of Courage), and T-Skill buff (Aria).
          - Generate Serenade Gauge by cycling meter generation skills as often as possible (Wind of Music, Prelude of Storm, Rhythm Buckshot, Soundholic), as well as meter gained from buffs and debuffs (Sonatina, Aria).
          - Protect your party via Shields and Damage Reduction (Wind of Music, Rhapsody of Light, Guardian Tune).
          - Go for counters with Rhythm Buckshot as it will reset your counter cooldown and refund all stacks, further increasing your meter generation.

              - With Rhapsody of Abundance leap node, grants 0.3 of a bubble.
              - Cycle this skill as often as possible for meter generation and the damage buff. It may be worth holding for long upcoming damage windows where the boss will be present for the entire duration.

          - With higher level cooldown gems, you can opt for less swiftness and more specialization. The swiftness recommendation listed is enough to hit 140% attack speed with 5% speed feast from the stronghold (1514). From level 9 gems and higher, you are able to build 30 spec. This grants higher identity buffing power (both efficiency and uptime) at the cost of longer cooldowns on utility skills (shields, damage reduction, MP recovery), lower uptime on Aria, and a tigher AP Buff cycle. While is is theoretically the ideal way to play, it is only recommended if you have high level gems and are extremely efficient at upkeeping AP Buff and Brand already (near 100% uptime).
          - 30/30 Specialization will also require the engraving Spirit Absorption, which usually replaces Expert.

        arkgrid_prose: |-
          Prioritize Seraphic Pulse > Seraphic Accent > Sound Deluge
          In theory, minimum is 14 on each, but you really want to et to 17p on each.
          Every combination of Sun/More core is viable, however Seraphic Pulse/Seraphic Accent (AP core) will have the most consistent performance. Brave Pulse/Brave Accent (identity core) is comparable, but it depends on your Serenade of Courage uptime. Any mix of Seraphic + Brave will suffice. Aria Accent/Aria Pulse (T core) is the weakest and will scale poorly with increased specialization, as you decrease your cooldown reduction, directly decreasing your Aria uptime. However, this build maintains higher swiftness.
          Seraphic and Brave ancients will always outperform the relic variants. Aria ancient will only outperform based on uptime, but this build prefers higher swiftness.
        priorities:
          - Upkeep main damage buffs and debuffs, including Attack Power Buff (Heavenly Tune, Sonic Vibration), Brand (Sonatina/Sound Shock), Identity Buff (Serenade of Courage), and T-Skill buff (Aria).
          - Generate Serenade Gauge by cycling meter generation skills as often as possible (Wind of Music, Prelude of Storm, Rhythm Buckshot, Soundholic), as well as meter gained from buffs and debuffs (Sonatina, Aria).
          - Protect your party via Shields and Damage Reduction (Wind of Music, Rhapsody of Light, Guardian Tune).

          - 1115 Crit = 53% with High CritRate% rings (Recommended).
          - Raid Captain is efficient with 136% movement speed, or 1281 Swiftness plus a 5% Feast. Excess stats should be placed into Swiftness (Recommended) or Specialization.
          - Specialization only increases Serenade meter generation. This does not increase buff efficiency or skill damage for True Courage Bard.
          - Hymn of Combat turns Serenade of Courage into another damage ability, but requires sticking close to the boss on cast.
          - You may take 3/3 Stormfield and 2/5 Mad Dash for a slight DPS loss, if the boss is mobile, or if you don’t like the shackle.

          - You have 5 seconds to send Tempest. DO NOT MISS.
          - Reposition Harp of Rhythm if necessary.
          - Cast meter generation skills during downtime.
        arkPassiveTips:
          - Adjust your crit rate as close to 100% without overcapping. It is fine to have 97-99%. Heavenly Tune provides +20% crit rate.
          - Swap to Keen Sense 1 if you need additional crit rate. Use Master + Critical if you need more.
          - 1115 Crit = 53% with High CritRate% rings (Recommended).
          - Raid Captain is efficient with 136% movement speed, or 1281 Swiftness plus a 5% Feast. Excess stats should be placed into Swiftness (Recommended) or Specialization.
          - Specialization only increases Serenade meter generation. This does not increase buff efficiency or skill damage for True Courage Bard.
          - Tempest, Vivace, and Hymn of Combat are not buffed by 17p Sun core, therefore we use 3/3 Stormfield instead.

        description: Spreads damage amongst Normal Skills at the cost of limited meter generation. Sound Shock becomes your bread and butter skill. Not forced to play in melee range. "Note:" As of July 2026, this build lacks significant damage (upwards of 12% compared to 11x) and NOT recommended. Play this build only because you want to.
        arkgrid_cores: Shock Loop + Harmonious Confluence + Binary Shock
        priorities:
          - Upkeep your damage synergy, Sonatina and maintain Adrenaline stacks.
          - Damage skills must be cast within Heavenly Tune window (8 seconds).
          - Destiny buffs your next two Sound Shock casts via Heavenly Tune.
          - Cast Serenade of Courage and Tempest at 2 or 3 bars.
          - You have 5 seconds to send Tempest. DO NOT MISS.
          - Reposition Harp of Rhythm if necessary.
        arkPassiveTips:
          - Adjust your crit rate as close to 100% without overcapping. It is fine to have 97-99%. Heavenly Tune provides +20% crit rate.
          - Swap to Keen Sense 1 if you need additional crit rate. Use Master + Critical if you need more.
          - 1115 Crit = 53% with High CritRate% rings (Recommended).
          - Raid Captain is efficient with 136% movement speed, or 1281 Swiftness plus a 5% Feast. Excess stats should be placed into Swiftness (Recommended).
          - Sun Core reduces meter generation by 100%. This means Specialization has no use for this build.
          - More priority on Normal Skills for damage, therefore we take 3/3 Stormfield and 2/5 Mad Dash.
